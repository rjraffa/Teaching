TouchOSC allows you to send OSC (open sound control) messages over a Wi-Fi network.

On a Mac, Place the file "OSC-Example.touchosc" from the zip file in the Documents/touchosc-default-layouts folder (not sure where the "touchosc-default-layouts" folder is on a PC so just search for that).

Before running the OSC Processing sketch, download the oscP5 library from the following link:

This address was pulled from the Processing Libraries page:

When you run the OSC Processing sketch, make sure that your mobile device
(whether iPhone or Android phone) and your computer are connected to the same network.

When you run the Processing sketch for the first time, you'll see the following information:

### [2011/9/12 22:25:8] INFO @ OscP5 is running. you (111.11.11.1) are listening @ port 8000

The value 111.11.11.1 will actually be the host address you should enter into TouchOSC on your device.
